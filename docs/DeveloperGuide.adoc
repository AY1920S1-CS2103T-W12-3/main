== Introduction

=== Purpose

This document describes the architecture and system design of _PalPay_.
It is a living document that evolves throughout the design and implementation for each release.
Each release will have an edition of the document, and the current edition of the document is for the first public release of the application.

This document aims to cover the high-level system architecture and design.
It is segmented into two major parts: software design, including system architecture, and design implementation.
The software design illustrates the main software components that operate and support the main system architecture.
Essential details such as the user stories, use cases, and the Non Functional Requirements are included at the back of this document.

=== Audience

This document is written for software engineers who desires a deeper insight of the system architecture and design of this application - PalPay.
In particular, the intended audience of this document will be the students taking on the roles of the developers, designers, and software testers of _PalPay_ from CS2103T - Software Engineering.

=== Description

_PalPay_ is a CLI application targeted for users who have poor financial management skills. The users should also prefer typing over mouse inputs.
It allows the users to keep track of daily financial transactions, as well as set a budget for a time duration to achieve long-term financial success. Additionally, users can keep a ledger of lending and borrowing of money with others so that the users can keep track of the flow of their money.

Below is the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of PalPay:

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its <<api, _API_>> in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The *_Sequence Diagram_* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component Interactions for `delete t1` Command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI Component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic Component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. `Logic` uses the `BankAccountParser` class to parse the user command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a transaction).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete t1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete t1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model Component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the User State data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<BankAccountOperation>`, `ObservableList<Budget>`, `ObservableList<LedgerOperation>` and `ObservableList<Projection>`
that can be 'observed'. +
For example, the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change due to user commands.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage Component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Bank Account data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::transaction[]
// tag::transaction1[]

=== Transaction: `in` / `out`

The `Transaction` abstract class allows user to input income and expense statements. Both `in` and `out` transactions requires the mandatory `Amount`, `Description` and `Date` fields to be appended. There is an optional `Category` field which can accept one or more input depending on the user specifications.
The `in` transactions will increase the `BankAccount` balance amount whilst the `out` transactions will reduce the `BankAccount` balance amount.

`In` Transactions represent the income statements inputted into Palpay.

`Out` Transactions represent the expenditure statements inputted into Palpay.

==== Current Implementation

// end::transaction1[]

Given below is an example usage of how `in` behaves at each step. `out` command follows a similar logic flow.

**Step 1**. The user executes `in $/200 n/coke d/10102019` to input a new income of $100 on 10th November 2019 under the *category* GENERAL.

**Step 2**. Upon executing the command, `LogicManager` uses `MainParser#parse` to parse this input from the user.

**Step 3**. `MainParser` determines which command is being executed and creates `InCommandParser` to further parse the input.

**Step 4**. `InCommandParser` parses the argument and checks the validity of arguments. If it is invalid, an exception is thrown.
Else, it returns a `InCommand`.

**Step 5**. `LogicManager` uses `InCommand#execute()` to add a new `InTransaction`.

**Step 6**. `BankAccount` then calls `InTransaction#handleBalance()` to increase its balance amount by $200.

**Step 7**. `InCommand` uses `Model#commitUserState()` to save the latest state of the application. It then
returns a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager` and the result will be displayed to the user.

// tag::transaction2[]

The sequence diagram below illustrates how PalPay handles the command input `in $/200 n/coke d/10102019`. The arguments are parsed into the logic component where the subsequent model objects are created.

.Sequence Diagram for Executing an `InCommand`
image::InSequenceDiagram.png[pdfwidth=70%]

The `in` and `out` transaction follows the same logic flow after they are parsed.

The difference between `in` and `out` transactions is that the `handleBalance()` method called in the `BankAccount` results in an `addAmount` operation for the `inTransaction` and a `subtractAmount` operation for the `OutTransaction` class.

===== Example
Given that the `BankAccount` balance initially starts with 0 dollars.

* `in` Transaction of `$1000` will increase the `BankAccount` balance from $0 to $1000.
* `out` Transaction of `$250` will subsequently decrease the `BankAccount` balance from $1000 to $250.
* The Activity Diagram shown below will provide a visual representation of the two routes a Transaction object can take.

.Activity Diagram for In and Out Transactions
image::InActivityDiagram.png[pdfwidth=70%]

==== Design Considerations

* To prevent repetitive code implementation, the `Transaction` abstract class is used to facilitate income and expenditure logging.  `Transaction` is an abstract class which contains the default constructor and commonly used variables. `InTransaction` and `OutTransaction` extends the `Transaction` class as they typically store an *amount*, *date*, *description*, and a set of *categories*.
A code snippet of the `Transaction` abstract class is shown below.

```
public abstract class Transaction {

    protected Amount amount;
    protected Date date;
    protected Description description;
    protected final Set<Category> categories = new HashSet<>();

    public Transaction(Amount amount, Date date, Description description) {
        this.amount = amount;
        this.date = date;
        this.description = description;
    }
```

* The balance in `BankAccount` and the balance in `Ledger` are considered two separate identities, both being encompassed under the `UserState` class.
Therefore user operations that deal with `BankAccount` implements the `BankAccountOperation` interface, while operations
that deal with `Ledger` implements the `LedgerOperation` interface. +
** This allows us to achieve polymorphism by overloading methods in `Model` to handle the different operations correctly.
** This reduces code coupling as there are different models to handle different balance amounts.

* A `Transaction` entry can affect a `Budget` which has similar categories and is within the same time period. The activity diagram bellow will further clarify this flow.
** Only `Out` Transactions can affect `Budget`.
** The activity diagram below shows how and when a `Transaction` object affects `Budget`.

.Activity Diagram for Out Transaction Affecting Budget
image::OutbudgetActivityDiagram.png[pdfwidth=70%]

// end::transaction2[]
// end::transaction[]

// tag::set[]
=== Set Budget Feature: `set`

The `Budget` class allows the user to set a budget for a given time period for a category, if specified.
The user is allowed to set multiple budgets, but duplicate budgets (budgets with the same identity in terms of *amount*, *date* and *category*) are not allowed.
Upon setting the budget, making `OutTransaction` will deduct the amount from relevant budgets in the list.
The detailed implementation of the process of updating the budget is explained further below in <<Current-Implementation, Current Implementation>>.

[[Current-Implementation]]
==== Current Implementation

The `set` command is an extension of parent `Command` class, facilitated by the _Logic_ and _Model_ components of the application, _PalPay_ +
Given an *amount* and *date*, a new Budget is set for the user. +
Upon setting a new budget, a `BudgetCard` is created and displayed in a list in the application window till the date set by the user. +

A `Budget` stores an *initial amount*, *amount* (the current amount), *deadline*, *categories*.
There is a need for a `Budget` to store both *initial amount* and *amount* as it allows for percentage of budget remaining to be calculated. +
Shown below is the class diagram of `Budget` class:

.Class Diagram of Budget class
image::BudgetClassDiagram.png[]


Displaying the percentage remaining improves the user experience greatly as our target user is a
`visual person who wants to see how much budget he has left in each category so as to cut down on spending as necessary`
as specified in the <<User-Stories, User Story>>. Hence, taking a quick glance at the `Budget card` allows the user to
determine how much of budget he has left, as well as be alarmed by the red font colour to spend less if he has overspent beyond the budget set. +

A snippet of the code which calculates the percentage of budget left is shown below:

```
public String displayPercentage() {
    double percentage = this.amount.divideAmount(this.initialAmount) * 100;
    if (percentage < 0.00) {
        percentage = 0.0; // should not display a negative percentage
    } else if (percentage > 100.00) {
        percentage = 100.0; // should not display a percentage greater than 100%
    }
    return String.format("%.2f%% remaining", percentage);
}
```

Moreover, as our user is a visual person, PalPay makes use of colour to display different messages.
For instance, budget is displayed in red to alert the user that he has overspent beyond the set budget. +

Shown below is an example of an overspent budget:

.Example of an Overspent Budget
image::overspentBudget.png[]


When setting a new `Budget`, existence of a duplicate budget is checked through a sequence of checks.
The activity diagram below shows the activity diagram of setting a new budget:


[[Duplicate-budget-check]]
.Activity Diagram of Setting a New Budget Successfully
image::SetBudgetSimpleActivityDiagram.png[]

As shown, a new budget cannot have the same *initalAmount*, *deadline* and *categories* as any other existing budget in
budget list. Allowing existence of duplicate budgets will crowd the interface of `Budget` tab,
which prevents the user from getting a quick overview of his budget status. Hence, a duplicate check is essential
in providing a pleasing user experience. +

==== Example of Usage

Given below is an example usage of how `set` behaves at each step.

**Step 1**. The user executes `set $/100 d/31122019 c/shopping` to set a new budget of $100 until 31st December 2019 under the *category* shopping.

.User Inputs `set $/100 d/31122019 c/shopping`
image::set_dg_1.png[]

**Step 2**. Upon executing the command, `LogicManager` uses `MainParser#parse` to parse the input from the user.

**Step 3**. `MainParser` determines which command is being executed and creates `SetCommandParser` to further parse the input.

**Step 4**. `SetCommandParser` parses the argument and checks if it is valid. If it is invalid, an exception is thrown.
Else, it returns a `SetCommand`.

**Step 5**. `LogicManager` uses `SetCommand#execute()` to add a new budget. +
`SetCommand` uses `ModelManager#has(Budget)` to check if it is a duplicate of an existing budget
in the `UniqueBudgetList` as shown above in <<Duplicate-budget-check, the above diagram>>.

**Step 6**. `SetCommand` uses `Model#commitUserState()` to save the latest state of the application. It then
returns a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager` and the result will be displayed to the user at the end.

.New Budget Successfully Created
image::set_dg_2.png[]


==== Design Considerations

Currently, `Budget` does not extend from `Transaction` although the two behave in a similar way.
There is an aggregation between `Budget` and `Transaction` as the two can exist independent of each other,
although an effect on one may also cause an impact on the other.
The current design was chosen over the former design of inheritance as there is a stark difference in the two
in a way that `Budget` does not affect the `balance` of the user's bank account directly while `Transaction` does.
Hence, by Liskov Substitution Principle, inheritance is not a suitable design. +

// end::set[]

// tag::split[]
=== Split Feature: `split`

This feature allows the user to pay for a certain item or make a transaction on behalf of his friends.
Refer to the <<UserGuide#Features, UserGuide>> for usage details.

==== Current Implementation
The `split` command is an abstraction of `LendMoney` class. +
Given a list of *shares* and *people*, each person is assigned an *amount* based on the corresponding positional share and the total amount given to `split` command. +
A `LendMoney` instance is created for each person and executed.


Below shows how a typical command from the user is executed by the program.

.Sequence Diagram for Executing a `SplitCommand`
image::Split.png[]

**Step 1**: User enters `split $/200 n/a n/b n/c a/desc` into the command line to split *$200* among *a*, *b* and *c*.

**Step 2**: Upon executing the command, `LogicManager` uses `MainParser#parse()` to parse the input from the user.

**Step 3**: `MainParser` determines that user input is an instance of a `SplitCommand` and creates a `SplitCommandParser`
to further parse the input.

**Step 4**: `SplitCommandParser` parses the command and checks if fields like amount and names are valid.
If all fields are valid, it returns a `SplitCommand`. Else, an error is thrown to the result box and the execution
terminates.

**Step 5**: `LogicManager` uses `SplitCommand#execute()` to update the balances of `Ledger` and people involved in the
transaction.

**Step 6**: `SplitCommand#execute()` calls `Model#add()` to add the user input into the user history.
Within the function call, the actual update of balances is handled in `Ledger#handleOperation()`.

**Step 7**: `SplitCommand` calls `Model#commitUserState()` after executing to save the latest state of the application.

**Step 8**: A `CommandResult` is then returned to the `LogicManager` which is then displayed to the user.


.Activity Diagram for Creating a `Split` Object
image::SplitBehaviour.png[pdfwidth=60%]

==== Design Considerations

Below shows how the classes involved with `Ledger` interact with each other.

.Class Diagram for Operations that Deal with Ledger
image::LedgerOperationDiagram.png[pdfwidth=60%]

Current implementation of `Split` class encourages code reuse by abstracting the delegating the task of rebalancing to another class. +
However, this introduces coupling as the behavior of `Split` is now inexplicably tied to `LendMoney`.

// end::split[]

//tag::receive[]
=== Settle Up Feature: `receive`

This feature allows another person to send money to the user. +
The balance in the `Ledger` and the balance of the sender is updated accordingly.

==== Current Implementation

The `receive` command creates `ReceiveMoney` class that handles the transfer of fund from another person to the user.

How `receive` relates to the rest of the `Ledger` classes can be inferred from the
class diagram above.

In the `handleBalance` method of `ReceiveMoney`, it will find the correct person in the `Ledger` by name,
or create a new `Person` with given *name* if it is not already in the `Ledger`. +
Balance of the user and the sender is then updated accordingly.

Below is an example usage scenario for how `receive` would behave.

**Step 1**: User enters `receive $/200 n/a` into the command line to settle up *$200* from *a*.

**Step 2**: Upon executing the command, `LogicManager` uses `MainParser#parse()` to parse the input from the user.

**Step 3**: `MainParser` determines that user input is an instance of a `ReceiveCommand` and creates a `ReceiveCommandParser`
to further parse the input.

**Step 4**: `ReceiveCommandParser` parses the command and checks if fields like amount and names are valid.
If all fields are valid, it returns a `ReceiveCommand`. Else, an error is thrown to the result box and the execution
terminates.

**Step 5**: `LogicManager` uses `ReceiveCommand#execute()` to update the balances of `Ledger` and the person in the
transaction.

**Step 6**: `ReceiveCommand#execute()` calls `Model#add()` to add the user input into the user history.
Within the function call, the person in `Ledger` is found and his/her outstanding balance is updated in `Ledger#handleOperation()`. +
If he is not already inside the `Ledger`, a new `Person` is created with the same name.

**Step 7**: `SplitCommand` calls `Model#commitUserState()` after executing to save the latest state of the application.

**Step 8**: A `CommandResult` is then returned to the `LogicManager` which is then displayed to the user.

.Code snippet of `handleBalance` in ReceiveMoney
```
public class ReceiveMoney extends Payment {
    @Override
    public Amount handleBalance(Amount balance, UniquePersonList peopleInLedger) {
        Person target = super.handleTarget(peopleInLedger);
        target.spend(amount);
        return balance.addAmount(amount);
    }
}

public abstract class Payment extends Transaction implements LedgerOperations {
    protected Person handleTarget(UniquePersonList peopleInLedger) {
        Person personInvolved = person;
        if (peopleInLedger.contains(person)) {
            personInvolved = peopleInLedger.get(person).get();
        } else {
            peopleInLedger.add(person);
        }
        return personInvolved;
    }
}
```
//end::receive[]

// tag::project1[]
[[Implementation-Projection]]
=== Project Feature: `project`

This feature allows users to _project_ their balance amount and budget statuses based on past income and outflows as manifest in their
_TransactionHistory_ by using the command `project DATE [CATEGORY]`.

==== Current Implementation

The `project` command is facilitated by the Logic and Model components of the application, _PalPay_.

The sequence diagram below demonstrates how the `project DATE [CATEGORY]` command is handled by the application.
If a `CATEGORY` is not specified by the user, it will be set as `GENERAL` by default.

.Sequence Diagram of the Project Command
image::ProjectSequenceDiagram.png[ProjectCommand Sequence Diagram]

===== Projection by Date

When projecting by date alone, all transactions in the _user_'s transaction list will be taken into account,
regardless of their categories. On the other hand, only budgets without categories (thus belonging to the
`GENERAL` category by default) will be projected upon.

===== Projection by Date and Category

When projecting by date and category, all transactions tagged by the specified category will be taken into account.
Similarly, all budgets tagged with the specified category will be projected upon.

===== Budget Projections

Projections on budgets are made by first projecting the _user_'s balance amount at the point when the budget was set.
Then, it compares the _user_'s projected balance amount at the point of the budget's deadline, with the budget's amount.
A surplus is indicated when the former is greater than the latter, and a deficit is indicated when the former is smaller
than the latter.
// end::project1[]
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the project command executes at each step.

**Step 1**. The user launches the application.

**Step 2**. If the user does not have at least *5* transactions, he / she adds transactions until
there are sufficient transactions to project upon. Then, the user executes the `project` command.

**Step 3**. Upon executing the command, `LogicManager` uses `MainParser#parse()` to parse the input from the user.

**Step 4**. `MainParser` determines which command is being used and creates `ProjectCommandParser` to further parse
the input from the user.

**Step 5**. `ProjectCommandParser` parses the argument and checks if a valid date and category was provided. +

* If an invalid date or category was provided, or if no date was provided, `ProjectCommandParser` throws an exception and terminates.

* Otherwise, it returns a `ProjectCommand`, which contains a `Date` and possibly a `Category` specified by the user.

**Step 6**. `LogicManager` uses `ProjectCommand#execute()` to project the user's balance and budget states at the time
of the specified `Date`.

**Step 7**. `ProjectCommand` uses `Model#commitUserState()` to save the latest state of the application. It then
returns a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager` and the result will be displayed to the user at the end.

// tag::project2[]
===== Activity Diagram

The activity diagram below depicts how a projection is made.

.Activity Diagram of the Project Command
image::ProjectActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Graphical Representation

A graphical representation of the _user_'s projections may be rendered using the `display` command.

==== Future Enhancements

===== Polynomial Regression

For simplicity of logic and design, the current implementation performs linear regression (via gradient descent),
projecting user balance and budget states using a best-fit straight line. Ultimately, income and spending trends
may not be best represented by a straight line, but rather by a polynomial equation. In future updates, the `projection`
feature will choose a value, _n_, and perform a _n-th_ degree polynomial regression, such that the user's balance
and budget states can be more accurately projected.

[NOTE]
Currently, the GradientDescent class implements feature scaling and mean normalisation. Although this
is not entirely necessary for the current implementation (which uses linear regression), it is meant
for optimizing polynomial regression in future updates.

===== Normal Equation

Currently, the gradient descent algorithm is used to plot the projection graph, which is used for predicting the
_user_'s balance and budget states at specified point in time. For smaller data sets, analytically computing the
normal equation to find the best-fit line graph may have result in a faster runtime. In future updates, the
normal equation method will be used in place of the gradient descent algorithm, for projections with less than
a set number (e.g. 500) of transactions.

==== Design Considerations
// end::project2[]

// tag::display1[]
=== Display Feature: `display`
This feature provides a graphical view of an existing projection to the _user_. +

==== Current Implementation
// end::display1[]
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the display command executes at each step.

**Step 1**. The user launches the application.

**Step 2**. If the user does not have any existing projections, he / she creates one or more projections.
Then, the user executes the `display` command.

**Step 3**. Upon executing the command, `LogicManager` uses `MainParser#parse()` to parse the input from the user.

**Step 4**. `MainParser` determines which command is being used and creates `DisplayCommandParser` to further parse
the input from the user.

**Step 5**. `DisplayCommandParser` parses the argument and checks if a valid type and index was provided. +

* If an invalid type or index was provided, or if no type or index was provided, `DisplayCommandParser` throws an exception and terminates.

* Otherwise, it returns a `DisplayCommand`, which contains a `Type` and an `Index` specified by the user.

**Step 6**. `LogicManager` uses `ProjectCommand#execute()` to display the specified `projection` in a
new window.

**Step 7**. `DisplayCommand` returns a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager` and the result will be displayed to the user at the end.
// tag::display2[]
The following activity diagram depicts how the `display` command is executed.

.Activity Diagram of the Display Command

For a more concrete illustration of how the `display` command is handled by _PalPay_,
a sequence diagram is provided below.

.Sequence Diagram of the Display Command

// end::display2[]

// tag::view[]
=== View Feature: `view`

This feature allows the user to switch between the different tabs of the application.

==== Current Implementation

The `view` command is facilitated by the `MainWindow`, `MainTabPanel`, `ViewCommandParser` and `ViewCommand`.

Given below is an example usage of how `view` behaves at each step.

**Step 1**. The user launches the application and views the transaction tab.

**Step 2**. The user now executes `view budget` to switch to the budget tab.

**Step 3**. Upon executing the command, `LogicManager` uses `MainParser#parse()` to parse the input from the user.

**Step 4**. `MainParser` determines which command is being used and creates `ViewCommandParser` to further parse the input
from the user.

**Step 5**. `ViewCommandParser` parses the argument and checks if it is valid. If it is
invalid, `ViewCommandParser` throws an exception and terminates. Else, it returns a `ViewCommand` that contains a `Tab`.

**Step 6**. `LogicManager` uses `ViewCommand#execute()` to switch to the budget tab.

**Step 7**. `ViewCommand` returns a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager` with the `Tab`. `LogicManager` then
returns the `CommandResult` to `MainWindow`.

**Step 8**. `MainWindow` checks if there is a need to switch `Tab`. If there is, `MainWindow` uses
`MainWindow#handleSwitchTab()` to switch tab. Else, `MainWindow` does nothing.

The following activity diagram shows the flow of the `view` command.

.Activity Diagram for `View`
image::ViewActivityDiagram.png[]
// end::view[]

// tag::delete[]
=== Delete Transaction Feature: `delete`

This feature allows the user to delete an existing transaction, budget, ledger or projection entry from their respective lists. +

==== Current Implementation

* The delete feature is facilitated by the Logic and Model components of the application.
* The delete feature works for `Transaction`, `Budget`, `Ledger` and `Projection` entries.

Given below is an example usage of how `delete` behaves at each step.

**Step 1**. The user executes `delete t1` to delete the first entry from the transaction list.

**Step 2**. Upon executing the command, `LogicManager` uses `MainParser#parse` to parse this input from the user.

**Step 3**. `MainParser` determines which command is being executed and creates `DeleteCommandParser` to further parse the input.

**Step 4**. `DeleteCommandParser` parses the argument and checks the validity of arguments. If it is invalid, an exception is thrown.
Else, it returns a `DeleteCommand`.

**Step 5**. `LogicManager` uses `DeleteCommand#execute()` to delete either the `Transaction`, `Budget`, `Ledger` or `Projection` from their respective unique lists.

**Step 6**. `DeleteCommand` uses `Model#commitUserState()` to save the latest state of the application. It then
returns a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager` and the result will be displayed to the user.

* The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `delete` command:

.Activity Diagram for `delete` command
image::DeleteActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Consideration

* The `delete` keyword is followed by a `TYPE+INDEX` parameter.
** `Transaction` entries takes in `t` as its `TYPE` parameter.
** `Budget` entries takes in `b` as its `TYPE` parameter.
** `Ledger` entries takes in `l` as its `TYPE` parameter.
** `Projection` entries takes in `p` as its `TYPE` parameter.
* The `index` parameter refers to the entry number within the `TYPE` entry's view tab.
* Example: `delete t5` deletes the 5th entry from the list of transactions if that particular entry exists.

===== Aspect: Delete requires `TYPE+INDEX` as one of its parameter

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** takes in `TYPE+INDEX` to decide whether to delete an item from Transaction, Budget, Ledger or Projection list. (e.g. `delete b1` deletes item index 1 from budget).
** Pros: Requires lesser user steps to be taken before executing a `delete` command.
** Cons: Requires four unique lists to be created instead of 1. (e.g. the `UniqueTransactionList` stores Transaction items and the `UniqueBudgetList` to store Budget items).
** For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to delete both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Change to **Transaction**, **Budget**, **Ledger** or **Projection** mode and keying in only index (e.g. `delete 1`)
** Pros: Requires only one unique list required to store all operation types.
** Cons: Requires additional user step to switch between modes before executing a updating command.

=== Update Existing Entry Feature: `update`

This feature currently allows users to update `Transaction` or `Budget` entries. The user is unable to perform this feature on `Ledger` operations. The rationale for this will be further explained in <<Aspect2>>. The user is currently unable to perform this feature on `Projection` operations as it will be further implemented in future updates.

==== Current Implementation

// end::update1[]

*  The update feature is facilitated by the Logic and Model components of the application.
* The parameter requirements differs for the type of entry:
** `Transaction` type requires at least one of it's `Amount`, `Description`, `Date` or `Category` fields to be updated.
** `Budget` type requires at least one of it's `Amount`, `Date` or `Category` fields to be updated.
** `Project` type requires it's `Date` and `Category` fields to be updated (Future implementation).
* At least one valid parameter must be changed when executing an `update` command. (i.e. `update b1` will result in an error as no fields are being changed).

**Step 1**. The user executes `update t2 $/200` to update the second entry's amount, from the transaction list, to $200 .

**Step 2**. Upon executing the command, `LogicManager` uses `MainParser#parse` to parse this input from the user.

**Step 3**. `MainParser` determines which command is being executed and creates `UpdateCommandParser` to further parse the input.

**Step 4**. `UpdateCommandParser` parses the argument and checks the validity of arguments. If it is invalid, an exception is thrown.
Else, it returns a `UpdateCommand`.

**Step 5**. `LogicManager` uses `UpdateCommand#execute()` to update either the `Transaction` or `Budget` from their respective unique lists.

**Step 6**. `UpdateCommand#execute()` uses the `UpdateTransactionDescriptor` class to create a new instance of a transaction or budget with the appended variables.

**Step 7**. `Model` from `UpdateCommand` then changes the necessary fields of this entry.

**Step 8**. `UpdateCommand` uses `Model#commitUserState()` to save the latest state of the application. It then
returns a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager` and the result will be displayed to the user.

* The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an update command:

.Activity Diagram for `update`
image::UpdateActivityDiagram.png[pdfwidth=70%]

// tag::update2[]
==== Design Considerations

The `update` feature allows one or more fields of a Transaction or Budget to be updated. (e.g. `update t1 $/2` and `update t1 $/2 d/10102019` will both work as intended).

More often than not, users do not need to change an entire Transaction or Budget entry. This will minimize inputs from users if they do not require every single parameters of a Transaction or Budget to be changed.

// end::update2[]

===== Aspect 1: Update requires `TYPE+INDEX` as one of its parameter

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** takes in `TYPE+INDEX` to decide whether to update an item from Transaction, Budget or Projection list. (e.g. `delete b1` deletes item index 1 from budget).
** Pros: Requires lesser user steps to be taken before executing an `update` command.
** Cons: Requires 2 unique lists to be utilized instead of 1. (e.g. the `UniqueTransactionList` stores Transaction items and the `UniqueBudgetList` to store Budget items).
** For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Change to **Transaction**, **Budget** or **Projection** mode and keying in only index (e.g. `update 1 ..`).
** Pros: Requires only one unique list required to store all operation types.
** Cons: Requires additional user step to switch between modes before executing a updating command.

// tag::update3[]
[[Aspect2]]
===== Aspect 2: Update can not edit Ledger Operations

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Update Command does not work with `Ledger` operations.
** Pros: Intuitive implementation and execution for the user.
** Cons: Requires excessive user operations.
*** The user has to first delete the `Ledger` operation that he/she wishes to change, followed by inputting the `Ledger` operation with the amended fields back into _PalPay_.
* **Alternative 2:** Update Command to also work with `Ledger` operations.
** Pros: Requires only one user command to append or change `Ledger` entries.
** Cons: Results in convoluted implementation and user experience. This will also hinder future permeability of the `Split` feature.
*** `Ledger` operations such as `split` includes many repeated fields (i.e. multiple `Persons` and `shares` list).
*** Will require several conditional user inputs to differentiate between the various repeated entities that the user wishes to amend.

==== Future Enhancements

===== Update feature for Projections
Currently the update feature has not been implemented for `Projection` operations. In future iterations of PalPay, the update feature should work seamlessly with `Projection` operations, similar to that of `Transaction` and `Budget` operations

The activity diagram below will provide a visual representation of the possible user routes using the `update` command after this enhancement has been implemented.

.Activity Diagram for Future `update`

// end::update[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort Feature: `sort`

This feature allows the user to sort their transactions by amount or date, in ascending and descending order.

==== Current Implementation

The `sort` command is facilitated by the Logic and Model components of the application.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sorting of transactions work when the user enters `sort date/d`.

.Sequence Diagram for `sort date/d`
image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[pdfwidth=80%]

==== Example of Usage

Given below is an example usage of how `sort` behaves at each step.

**Step 1**. The user launches the application and views an unsorted list of transactions.

.Initial State of PalPay
image::sort_dg_1.png[pdfwidth=80%]

**Step 2**. The user now executes `sort date/d` to sort the transactions in the order of descending date.

.User Inputs `sort date/d`
image::sort_dg_2.png[pdfwidth=80%]

**Step 3**. Upon executing the command, `LogicManager` uses `MainParser#parse()` to parse the input from the user.

**Step 4**. `MainParser` determines which command is being used and creates `SortCommandParser` to further parse the input
from the user.

**Step 5**. `SortCommandParser` parses the argument and checks if it is valid. If it is
invalid, `SortCommandParser` throws an exception and terminates. Else, it returns a `SortCommand`.

**Step 6**. `LogicManager` uses `SortCommand#execute()` to sort the transactions in the order of descending date.

**Step 7**. `SortCommand` uses `ModelManager#getBankAccount()` to get the current bank account and uses
`BankAccount#getTransactionHistory()` to get the list of transactions of the user.

**Step 8**. `SortCommand` uses `SortCommand#sortTransactionHistory()` to sort the transactions.

**Step 9**. `SortCommand` uses `Model#set()` to store the sorted transactions and `Model#commitUserState()` to
save the latest state of the application.

**Step 10**. `SortCommand` returns a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager` and the result will be displayed to the user
at the end.

.After Sorting of Transactions
image::sort_dg_3.png[pdfwidth=80%]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Sorting of the Bank Account

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Creating a comparator for each area to be sorted.
** **Pros:** Easy to implement.
** **Cons:** Users can only sort by comparators that have been implemented.
Developers have to create a new comparator class to sort a new area.
* **Alternative 2:** Users can define the area to be sorted.
** **Pros:** Extremely flexible for the users as they are not limited to the number of areas to be sorted.
** **Cons:** Difficult to implement.

// end::sort[]

// tag::filter[]
=== Filter Feature: `filter`

This feature allows the user to filter the list of transactions by category, description, month and/or year.

==== Overview

The `FilterCommandParser` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `FilterCommandParser#parse()`: This operation will take in at least one `String` input from the user that represents
different fields delimited by a whitespace. All transactions that contains all fields will be displayed in the
transaction tab.

==== Current Implementation

The `filter` command is facilitated by the `FilterCommandParser` and `FilterCommand` of the application.
PalPay filters the list of transactions by checking if the specified fields exist in the transaction.

For instance, the command `filter c/breakfast m/11 y/2019` would display a list of transactions that were made during
breakfast in November 2019.

The following class diagram depicts the relations of the FilterCommand, FilterCommandParser and its related classes.

.Class Diagram for `Filter`
image::FilterClassDiagram.png[]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**. The user launches the application and views an unfiltered list of transactions.

**Step 2**. The user now executes `filter c/breakfast m/11 y/2019` to filter the list of transactions.

**Step 3**. Upon executing the command, `LogicManager` uses `MainParser#parse()` to parse the input from the user.

**Step 4**. `MainParser` determines which command is being used and creates `FilterCommandParser` to further parse
the input from the user.

**Step 5**. `FilterCommandParser` parses the argument and checks if category, description, month or year exists.
If all field are not present, `FilterCommandParser` throws an exception and terminates, as depicted in the following
activity diagram.
Else, it returns a `FilterCommand` that contains a `TransactionPredicate`.

**Step 6**. `LogicManager` uses `FilterCommand#execute()` to update the list of transactions that satisfies the
given `TransactionPredicate`.

**Step 7**. `FilterCommand` uses `Model#commitUserState()` to save the latest state of the application. It then
returns a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager` and the result will be displayed to the user at the end.

Below is an activity diagram shows the process of invoking the `filter` command.

.Activity Diagram for `Filter`

// end::filter[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo / Redo Command Feature: `undo`/`redo`

==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedUserState`.
It extends `UserState` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `userStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedUserState#commit()` -- Saves the current user state in its history.
* `VersionedUserState#undo()` -- Restores the previous user state from its history.
* `VersionedUserState#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone user state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitUserState()`, `Model#undoUserState()`
and `Model#redoUserState()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `VersionedUserState` will be initialized with the initial user state, and the `currentStatePointer`
pointing to that single user state.

.Initial State
image::UndoRedoState0.png[pdfwidth=50%, align="center"]

**Step 2**. The user executes `delete t5` command to delete the 5th transaction in the transaction list.
The `delete` command calls `Model#commitUserState()`, causing the modified state of the user state after the
`delete t5` command executes to be saved in the `userStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted
to the newly inserted user state.

.After `delete t1` Command
image::UndoRedoState1.png[pdfwidth=50%, align="center"]

**Step 3**. The user executes `in $/10 n/Allowance d/07112019` to log a new transaction.
The `in` command also calls `Model#commitUserState()`, causing another modified user state to be saved
into the `userStateList`.

.After `in $/10 n/Allowance d/07112019` Command
image::UndoRedoState2.png[pdfwidth=50%, align="center"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitUserState()`, so the user state will
not be saved into the `userStateList`.

**Step 4**. The user now decides that logging the transaction was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by
executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoUserState()`, which will shift the
`currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous user state, and restores the user state
to that state.

.After `undo` Command
image::UndoRedoState3.png[pdfwidth=50%, align="center"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial user state, then there are no previous
user states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoUserState()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

**Step 5**. The user then decides to execute the command `list`.
Commands that do not modify the user state, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitUserState()`,
`Model#undoUserState()` or `Model#redoUserState()`. Thus, the `userStateList` remains unchanged.

.After `list` Command
image::UndoRedoState4.png[pdfwidth=50%, align="center"]

**Step 6**. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitUserState()`.
Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `userStateList`, all user states after
the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the
`in $/10 n/Allowance d/07112019` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

.After `clear` Command
image::UndoRedoState5.png[pdfwidth=50%, align="center"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Undo Sequence Diagram
image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoUserState()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer`
once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the user state to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `userStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest user state, then
there are no undone user states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoUserState()` to
check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

===== Aspect: How Undo and Redo Executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire user state.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete t1`, just save the transaction being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Which Data Structure to Support the Undo/Redo Commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list and a pointer to store the history of user states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand,
who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Need to manage the list and pointer carefully as the pointer has to point to the correct position in
the list at all times.
For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `userStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use two stacks. One stack stores the commands to undo and the other stores the commands to redo.
** Pros: Do not need to manage a pointer for the stacks.
** Cons: Need to manage both stacks carefully. For instance, when a command is popped from the undo stack, it needs to
be pushed into the redo stack.
// end::undoredo[]


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size
