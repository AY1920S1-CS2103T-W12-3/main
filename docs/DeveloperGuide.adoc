== Introduction

=== Purpose

This document describes the architecture and system design of _PalPay_.
It is a living document that evolves throughout the design and implementation for each release.
Each release will have an edition of the document, and the current edition of the document is for the first public release of the application.

This document is aimed at covering the high-level system architecture and design.
It is segmented into two major parts: software design, including system architecture, and design implementation.
The software design documents the main software components that operate and support the main system architecture.
Essential details such as the user stories and use cases, as well as the Non Functional Requirements are included at the back of the document.

=== Audience

This document is written for software engineers want to gain an insight of the system architecture and design of the application.
In particular, the intended audience of this document is the students taking the roles of the developers, designers, and software testers of _PalPay_ from CS2103T - Software Engineering.

=== Description

_PalPay_ is a CLI application targeted for users who have poor financial management skills. The users should also prefer typing over mouse inputs.
It allows the users to keep track of daily financial transactions, as well as set a budget for a time duration to achieve long-term financial success.
Not only that, users can keep a ledger of lending and borrowing of money with others so that the users can keep track of the flow of their money.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete t1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI Component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic Component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. `Logic` uses the `BankAccountParser` class to parse the user command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a transaction).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete t1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete t1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model Component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

// TODO: check accuracy?
The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Bank Account data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<BankOperation>` and `ObservableList<Budget>`
that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change due to user command.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

//[NOTE]
//As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference.
//This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.
//An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
//+
//image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

//TODO: update
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage Component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Bank Account data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::transaction[]
=== Transaction: `in` / `out` / `split` / `receive`

The `Transaction` abstract class allows user to input income, expense or split commands into the PalPay.

==== Current Implementation

`Transaction` is an abstract class which contains the default constructor and commonly used functions. `InTransaction` and `OutTransaction` extends the `Transaction` class.
`Transaction` stores an *amount*, *date*, *description*, and a set of *categories*. This describes the variables a `Transaction` with the `BankAccount` will typically hold.
`InTransaction` and `OutTransaction` implements `BankAccountOperation`.

==== Design Considerations

Implementation of `Transaction` abstract class allows code reuse as different types of transactions depends on similar variables. +
The balance in `BankAccount` is considered separate from the balance in `Ledger`, both being encompassed in `UserState`.
Therefore user operations that deal with `BankAccount` implements the `BankAccountOperation` interface, while operations
that deal with `Ledger` implements the `LedgerOperation` interface. +
This allows us to achieve polymorphism by overloading methods in `Model` to handle the different operations correctly.

// end::transaction[]

// tag::set[]
=== Set Budget Feature: `set`

This feature allows the user to set a budget for a given time period for a category, if specified.
The user is allowed to set multiple budgets, but duplicate budgets (budgets with the same identity in terms of *amount*, *date* and *tag*) are not allowed.
Upon setting the budget and prior to the deadline, the user's `OutTransaction` will deduct the amount from each budget in the list respectively.

==== Current Implementation

The `set` command is an extension of parent `Command` class, facilitated by the _Logic_ and _Model_ components of the application, _PalPay_ +
Given an *amount* and *date*, a new Budget is set for the user. +
Upon setting a new budget, a `BudgetCard` is created and displayed in a list in the application window till the date set by the user. +

// TODO: add PUML figure for Sequence diagram


==== Design Considerations

Currently, `Budget` does not extend from `Transaction` although the two behave in a similar way.
There is an aggregation between `Budget` and `Transaction` as the two can exist independent of each other,
although an effect on one may also cause an impact on the other.
The current design was chosen over the former design of inheritance as there is a stark difference in the two
in a way that `Budget` does not affect the `balance` of the user's bank account directly while `Transaction` does.
Hence, by Liskov Substitution Principle, inheritance is not a suitable design. +

// end::set[]

// tag::split[]
=== Split Feature: `split`

This feature allows the user to pay for a certain item or make a transaction on behalf of his friends.
Refer to the <<UserGuide#Features, UserGuide>> for usage details.

==== Current Implementation

The `split` command is an abstraction of `LendMoney` class. +
Given a list of *shares* and *people*, each person is assigned an *amount* based on the corresponding positional share and the total amount given to `split` command. +
A `LendMoney` instance is created for each person and executed.

.Class diagram for operations that deal with Ledger
image::LedgerOperationDiagram.png[]

.Activity diagram for creating a `Split` object
image::SplitBehaviour.png[]

==== Design Considerations

Current implementation of `Split` class encourages code reuse by abstracting the delegating the task of rebalancing to another class. +
However, this introduces coupling as the behavior of `Split` is now inexplicably tied to `LendMoney`.

.Sequence diagram for executing a `SplitCommand`
image::Split.png[]

// end::split[]

=== Settle Up Feature: `receive`

This feature allows another person to send money to the user. +
The balance in the `Ledger` and the balance of the sender is updated accordingly.

==== Current Implementation

The `receive` command creates `ReceiveMoney` class that handles the transfer of fund from another person to the user.

In the `handleBalance` method of `ReceiveMoney`, it will find the correct person in the `Ledger` by name,
or create a new `Person` with given *name* if it is not already in the `Ledger`. +
Balance of the user and the sender is then updated accordingly.

.Code snippet of `handleBalance` in ReceiveMoney
```
public class ReceiveMoney extends Payment {
    @Override
    public Amount handleBalance(Amount balance, UniquePersonList peopleInLedger) {
        Person target = super.handleTarget(peopleInLedger);
        target.spend(amount);
        return balance.addAmount(amount);
    }
}

public abstract class Payment extends Transaction implements LedgerOperations {
    protected Person handleTarget(UniquePersonList peopleInLedger) {
        Person personInvolved = person;
        if (peopleInLedger.contains(person)) {
            personInvolved = peopleInLedger.get(person).get();
        } else {
            peopleInLedger.add(person);
        }
        return personInvolved;
    }
}
```

// tag::project[]
[[Implementation-Projection]]
=== Project Feature: `project`

This feature allows users to _project_ their balance amount and budget statuses based on past income and outflows as manifest in their
_TransactionHistory_ by using the command `project DATE [CATEGORY]`.

==== Current Implementation

The `project` command is facilitated by the Logic and Model components of the application, _PalPay_.

The sequence diagram below demonstrates how the `project DATE [CATEGORY]` command is handled by the application.
If a `CATEGORY` is not specified by the user, it will be set as `GENERAL` by default.

.Sequence Diagram of the Project Command
image::ProjectSequenceDiagram.png[ProjectCommand Sequence Diagram]

===== Projection by Date

When projecting by date alone, all transactions in the _user_'s transaction list will be taken into account,
regardless of their categories. On the other hand, only budgets without categories (thus belonging to the
`GENERAL` category by default) will be projected upon.

===== Projection by Date and Category

When projecting by date and category, all transactions tagged by the specified category will be taken into account.
Similarly, all budgets tagged with the specified category will be projected upon.

===== Budget Projections
Projections on budgets are made by first projecting the _user_'s balance amount at the point when the budget was set.
Then, it compares the _user_'s projected balance amount at the point of the budget's deadline, with the budget's amount.
A surplus is indicated when the former is greater than the latter, and a deficit is indicated when the former is smaller
than the latter.

===== Activity Diagram
The activity diagram below depicts how a projection is made.

.Activity Diagram of the Project Command
image::ProjectActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Graphical Representation
A graphical representation of the _user_'s projections may be rendered using the `display` command.

==== Future Enhancements

===== Polynomial Regression
For simplicity of logic and design, the current implementation performs linear regression (via gradient descent),
projecting user balance and budget states using a best-fit straight line. Ultimately, income and spending trends
may not be best represented by a straight line, but rather by a polynomial equation. In future updates, the `projection`
feature will choose a value, _n_, and perform a _n-th_ degree polynomial regression, such that the user's balance
and budget states can be more accurately projected.

[NOTE]
Currently, the GradientDescent class implements feature scaling and mean normalisation. Although this
is not entirely necessary for the current implementation (which uses linear regression), it is meant
for optimizing polynomial regression in future updates.

===== Normal Equation
Currently, the gradient descent algorithm is used to plot the projection graph, which is used for predicting the
_user_'s balance and budget states at specified point in time. For smaller data sets, analytically computing the
normal equation to find the best-fit line graph may have result in a faster runtime. In future updates, the
normal equation method will be used in place of the gradient descent algorithm, for projections with less than
a set number (e.g. 500) of transactions.

==== Design Considerations
// end::project[]

=== Display Feature `display`
This feature provides a graphical view of an existing projection to the _user_. +

==== Current Implementation
The following activity diagram depicts how the `display` command is executed.

.Activity Diagram of the Display Command
image::DisplayActivityDiagram.png[]

For a more concrete illustration of how the `display` command is handled by _PalPay_,
a sequence diagram is provided below.

.Sequence Diagram of the Display Command
image::DisplaySequenceDiagram.png[]


// end::display[]

// tag::view[]
=== View Feature: `view`

This feature allows the user to switch between the different tabs of the application.

==== Current Implementation

The `view` command is facilitated by the `MainWindow`, `MainTabPanel`, `ViewCommandParser` and `ViewCommand`.

The following activity diagram shows the flow of the `view` command.

.Activity Diagram for `View`
image::ViewActivityDiagram.png[]
// end::view[]

// tag::delete[]
=== Delete Transaction Feature: `delete`

This feature allows the user to delete an existing transaction or budget from the list. +
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes Delete command:

.Activity Diagram of Delete Command
image::DeleteActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Current Implementation

`Transaction` is an abstract class which implements `UndoableAction`. `inTransaction` and `outTransaction` extend the `Transaction` class.
`Transaction` stores an *amount*, *date* and a set of *categories* which describe the variables a `Transaction` with the `BankAccount` will typically hold.
`Split` transaction is the only dependency that relies on an additional `peopleInvolved` variable.
`inTransaction` and `outTransaction` implement `BankAccountOperation`.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Delete requires `TYPE+INDEX` as one of its parameter

Implementation of `Transaction` abstract class allows code reuse as different types of transactions depends on similar variables.
`inTransaction` and `outTransaction` can be referenced by making a call to `BankAccountOperation`,
this `BankAccountOperation` is then passed as an argument to `Logic` components and multiple CRUD commands.
This allows multiple transaction calls within the same method.

// end::delete[]

// tag::update[]
=== Update: `update`

This feature allows users to update either the **Amount**, **Date** or **Category** of either a Transaction or Budget.

==== Design Considerations

This `update` feature allows one or more fields of a Transaction or Budget to be updated. (e.g. `update t1 $/2` and `update t1 $/2 d/10102019` will both work as intended). This will minimize the need to input all non-required parameters if a user does not require all parameters of a Transaction or Budget to be changed.

===== Aspect: Update requires `TYPE+INDEX` as one of its parameter

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** takes in `TYPE+INDEX` to decide whether to delete an item from Transaction or Budget list. (e.g. `delete b1` deletes item index 1 from budget).
** Pros: Requires lesser user steps to be taken before executing a `update` command
** Cons: Requires two lists to be created instead of 1. The `UniqueTransactionList` stores Transaction items and `UniqueBudgetList` to store Budget items.
For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Change to **Transaction** or **Budget** mode and keying in only index (e.g. `update 1`)
** Pros: Requires only one unique list required to store both Transactions and Budgets.
** Cons: Requires additional user step to switch between modes before executing a updating command.

// end::update[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort Feature: `sort`

This feature allows the user to sort their transactions by amount or date, in ascending and descending order.

==== Current Implementation

The `sort` command is facilitated by the Logic and Model components of the application.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sorting of transactions work when the user enters `sort date/d`.

.Sequence Diagram for `sort date/d`
image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Example of Usage

Given below is an example usage of how `sort` behaves at each step.

**Step 1**. The user launches the application and views an unsorted list of transactions.

.Initial State of PalPay
image::sort_dg_1.png[]

**Step 2**. The user now executes `sort date/d` to sort the transactions in the order of descending date.

.User Inputs `sort date/d`
image::sort_dg_2.png[]

**Step 3**. Upon executing the command, `LogicManager` uses `MainParser#parse()` to parse the input from the user.

**Step 4**. `MainParser` determines which command is being used and creates `SortCommandParser` to further parse the input
from the user.

**Step 5**. `SortCommandParser` parses the argument and checks if it is valid. If it is
invalid, `SortCommandParser` throws an exception and terminates. Else, it returns a `SortCommand`.

**Step 6**. `LogicManager` uses `SortCommand#execute()` to sort the transactions in the order of descending date.

**Step 7**. `SortCommand` uses `ModelManager#getBankAccount()` to get the current bank account and uses
`BankAccount#getTransactionHistory()` to get the list of transactions of the user.

**Step 8**. `SortCommand` uses `SortCommand#sortTransactionHistory()` to sort the transactions.

**Step 9**. `SortCommand` uses `Model#setTransactions()` to store the sorted transactions and `Model#commitUserState` to
save the latest state of the application.

**Step 10**. `SortCommand` returns a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager` and the result will be displayed to the user
at the end.

.After Sorting of Transactions
image::sort_dg_3.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Sorting of the Bank Account

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Creating a comparator for each area to be sorted.
** **Pros:** Easy to implement.
** **Cons:** Users can only sort by comparators that have been implemented.
Developers have to create a new comparator class to sort a new area.
* **Alternative 2:** Users can define the area to be sorted.
** **Pros:** Extremely flexible for the users as they are not limited to the number of areas to be sorted.
** **Cons:** Difficult to implement.

// end::sort[]

// tag::filter[]
=== Filter Feature: `filter`

This feature allows the user to filter the list of transactions by category, description, month and/or year.

==== Overview

The `FilterCommandParser` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `FilterCommandParser#parse()`: This operation will take in at least one `String` input from the user that represents
different fields delimited by a whitespace. All transactions that contains all fields will be displayed in the
transaction tab.

==== Current Implementation

The `filter` command is facilitated by the `FilterCommandParser` and `FilterCommand` of the application.
PalPay filters the list of transactions by checking if any of the specified fields exist in the transaction.

For instance, the command `filter c/breakfast c/dinner` would display a list of transactions with categories
of breakfast or dinner or both.

The following class diagram depicts the relations of the FilterCommand, FilterCommandParser and its related classes.

.Class Diagram for `Filter`
image::FilterClassDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Filtering by multiple categories

* **Alternative 1 (Current Choice):** Creating one predicate for all categories to be sorted.
** **Pros:** Extremely flexible for the users as they are not limited to the number of categories to be filtered.
** **Cons:** Difficult to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Creating a predicate for each category to be sorted.
** **Pros:** Easy to implement.
** **Cons:** Users can only filter by predicates that have been implemented.
Developers have to create a new predicate class to filter a new category.

// end::filter[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo / Redo Command Feature: `undo`/`redo`

==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedUserState`.
It extends `UserState` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `userStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedUserState#commit()` -- Saves the current user state in its history.
* `VersionedUserState#undo()` -- Restores the previous user state from its history.
* `VersionedUserState#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone user state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitUserState()`, `Model#undoUserState()`
and `Model#redoUserState()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1**. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `VersionedUserState` will be initialized with the initial user state, and the `currentStatePointer`
pointing to that single user state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

**Step 2**. The user executes `delete t5` command to delete the 5th transaction in the transaction list.
The `delete` command calls `Model#commitUserState()`, causing the modified state of the user state after the
`delete t5` command executes to be saved in the `userStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted
to the newly inserted user state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

**Step 3**. The user executes `in $/10 n/Allowance d/07112019` to log a new transaction.
The `in` command also calls `Model#commitUserState()`, causing another modified user state to be saved
into the `userStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitUserState()`, so the user state will
not be saved into the `userStateList`.

**Step 4**. The user now decides that logging the transaction was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by
executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoUserState()`, which will shift the
`currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous user state, and restores the user state
to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial user state, then there are no previous
user states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoUserState()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.


**Step 5**. The user then decides to execute the command `list`.
Commands that do not modify the user state, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitUserState()`,
`Model#undoUserState()` or `Model#redoUserState()`. Thus, the `userStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

**Step 6**. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitUserState()`.
Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `userStateList`, all user states after
the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the
`in $/10 n/Allowance d/07112019` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoUserState()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer`
once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the user state to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `userStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest user state, then
there are no undone user states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoUserState()` to
check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

===== Aspect: How Undo and Redo Executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire user state.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete t1`, just save the transaction being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

//===== Aspect: Data Structure to Support the Undo/Redo Commands
//
//* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of user states.
//** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand,
//who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
//** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice.
//For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
//* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
//** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
//** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands.
//Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]




=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
