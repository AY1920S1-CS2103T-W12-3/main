== Overview

This portfolio documents my contributions to PalPay, a software engineering project under the module,
CS2103T Software Engineering. For this module, we were provided with a working software application which we
could enhance or morph to suit our target audience.

For the project, my main role was the System Tester where I ensured the application was free from bugs and good code
quality.
