== Overview

This portfolio documents my contributions to PalPay, a software engineering project under the module,
CS2103T Software Engineering. PalPay is an expenditure tracking application.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC

For the project, my main role was to implement the Split features, which allow the user to record
when bills are split between friends and when they settle up.

== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed*: https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-w12-3.github.io/publish-RepoSense/#search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=dingyuchen&tabRepo=AY1920S1-CS2103T-W12-3%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[RepoSense]

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented the `Ledger` tab and functions associated with it.

** What it does:
*** Allow user to split a bill easily between people. This can be by shares, or evenly, with or without including the user.
*** Allow individuals to settle up.

** Justification: In our target demographic, many express that keep track of transactions between friends.
Our application aims to solve this pain point by providing a simple way to keep track of debts.


** Highlights: The `Ledger` tab has a split screen user interface, for the user to keep track
of unpaid dollars and each transaction recorded between friends.
The `Ledger` will only display people with outstanding balances on the left side of the screen, while
transactions are listed on the right.
