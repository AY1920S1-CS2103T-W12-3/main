== Introduction
This project portfolio documents my contribution to the software project PalPay.

=== About the team
PalPay is a project collectively done by five Sophomore Computer Science Undergraduate students
in National University of Singapore. As part of a requirement for our module - CS2103T Software Engineering,
we morphed an existing product called Address Book (Level 3) given constraints
that the user must interact with it using Command Line Interface (CLI).

=== About the project
PalPay is a desktop application that is target to students who have limited time to keep track of their incomes
and expenditure and wish to have a simple and quick means to take charge of their finances.
Also recognising the problem faced by many students that they cannot keep track of lending and borrowing of money with friends,
PalPay offers a ledger function which keeps track of the movement of money between friends on a daily basis.

This is what PalPay looks like:

With my role as a developer for this project, I implemented the budget function.
Understanding that many students have a poor management of their expenses, PalPay budget function allows them to set a budget
so that they can be more conscious of their expenditure. As they make expenses in that particular category,
the budget will indicate the amount of money left from the budget and serve as a constant reminder for them to make smart financial choices.


== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation and other helpful contributions to the team in this project.

*Enhancement added*: I added the ability to set a budget in the bank account
*	What it does: The `set` command allows the user to set a budget until a deadline in a given category.
As the user makes `OutTransaction` s of the given category, he can see the percentage of remaining budget, as well as the number of days remaining.

*	Justification: As the user wishes to manage his expenses and restrict the overspending of money,
setting the budget is useful in allowing the user to track the outflow of his money.
Moreover, as the deadline he set approaches or upon exceeding the set budget,
the budget card displays red font which alerts the user that he needs to manage his finance better.
More details will be discussed below in the <<User-guide, user guide>> and <<Developer-guide, developer guide>>.

*	Highlights: This enhancement is based on `Budget` class which is a build-up of the current
`Transaction` class. While `Transaction` class allows the user to key in inflows and outflows of money,
`Budget` allows the user to have an indication of the outflows in a given category.
As the two classes behaves as though `Budget` is a child class of `Transaction`,
an in-depth analysis of design alternatives was necessary to ensure that Liskov Substitution Principal
was not violated. More details will be elaborated in section <<Design-Considerations, Design Considerations>> in the Developer guide excerpt below.
