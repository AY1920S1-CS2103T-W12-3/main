== Introduction

PalPay is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing personal finances*.
More importantly, PalPay is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, PalPay can get your finance management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
This User Guide is written for the users of PalPay as an introductory document of the application.
You are strongly encouraged to read this document before using the application to enjoy the full functionality of the application.

[[Features]]
== Features

=== Transactions

=== Budgets

=== Ledgers

=== Projections
By using the _Projections_ feature, you can project your:

[[In]]
=== Logging Income : `in`

Have an income that you need to log down? PalPay accepts all income inputs through the `in` command. Inputting an `in` command will increase the overall balance value. Your income statements have the added option to be tagged under one or more categories. You can do so by including the `[c/CATEGORY]` parameter in your command line. All uncategorized incomes will be tagged under the `GENERAL` category.

==== Command Syntax

Format: `in $/AMOUNT n/ITEM d/DATE [c/CATEGORY]`

****
* `AMOUNT` accepts the value of this income. The `AMOUNT` value must be non-negative, non zero and lesser than 1,000,000.
* `ITEM` accepts the description of this income.
* `DATE` accepts accepts the date of this transaction
* `CATEGORY` accepts the CATEGORY for this income. An in` Transaction can be created without `CATEGORY` inputs.
* `in` updates the Bank Account with a net positive amount (e.g. `in n/work $/1000 d/10102019` will **increase** Bank Acount balance by $1000)
****

==== Example Usage

===== Example 1

  in $/120 d/31122019 n/work

. Logging income
* Inputs an income of $120 with description set to 'work' and date set on 31/12/2019.
* The income has not utilized the optional `CATEGORY` field.
* Initial balance (red box in Figure 1) has a value of $0.
+
.Income Logging Example 1
image::in_ug_1.png[]
+
. Income added
* The income is added to the empty *Transactions* tab.
* The added income is given a `GENERAL` category.
* Balance has increased from $0 to $120 (red box in Figure 2).
+
.Sample Income 1 Added

* `in $/120 d/31122019 n/helping friend`

[[Out]]
=== Logging Expense : `out`

Have you recently made an expenditure that requires logging down? PalPay accepts all expenditure inputs through the `out` command. Inputting an `out` command will decrease the overall balance value. Your expenditure statements, just like the income statements, have the added option to be tagged under one or more categories. You can do so by including the `[c/CATEGORY]` parameter in your command line. All uncategorized incomes will be tagged under the `GENERAL` category.

==== Command Syntax

Format: `out $/AMOUNT n/ITEM d/DATE [c/CATEGORY]`

****
* `AMOUNT` accepts the value of this expenditure. The `AMOUNT` value must be non-negative, non zero and lesser than 1,000,000.
* Users should not input negative values into `AMOUNT` (i.e. `out $/-100 ...`) as PalPay has already accounted for the difference between incomes and expenditures.
* `ITEM` accepts the description of this expenditure.
* `DATE` accepts the date of this transaction
* `CATEGORY` accepts the CATEGORY for this expenditure. An `out` Transaction can be created without any `CATEGORY`.
* `out` will update the Bank Account with a net **negative** amount (e.g. `out n/milk $/2 d/10102019` will **decrease** Bank Acount balance by $2)
****

==== Important Details:

* Note that `out` transactions differ from `in` transactions in the display amount. The `in` transactions are characterized by the *positive* value within their display box whilst the `out` transactions are characterized by the *negative* values in their display box. The difference can be observed in the example usage below.
* `out` Transaction will affect the remaining amount of `Budget` entries with similar categories within the same time period (Refer to example 3).

==== Example Usage

===== Example 1

 out $/5 d/01012020 n/burger

. Expenditure logging
* Inputs an expenditure of $5 with description set to 'burger' and date set on 01/01/2020.
* The expenditure has not utilized the optional `CATEGORY` field.
* Initial balance (red box in Figure 5) has a value of $620.50.
+
.Expenditure Logging Example 1
image::out_ug_1.png[]
+
. Expenditure added
* The expenditure is added to the bottom of the *Transactions* tab.
* The amount value of the expenditure box should display a negative value (see Figure 6 entry 3).
* The added expenditure is given a `GENERAL` category.

[[Set]]
=== Setting a Budget : `set`

You can set a budget for a particular category until a certain date, given it is not already present in the budget list.
A duplicate budget is a budget with the same `AMOUNT` and `DATE` and `CATEGORY`. +
If you attempt to do so, you will receive an error message: `This budget already exists`. +

Format: `set $/AMOUNT d/DATE c/CATEGORY`

****
* `AMOUNT` input accepts the new budget amount to be set. This amount must be non-negative, non-zero and
less than 1,000,000.
* `DATE` input accepts the deadline to be set. It cannot be a date in the past.
* `CATEGORY` accepts the CATEGORY for the budget. A budget can be created without `CATEGORY` inputs in which case, the budget will automatically be assigned `GENERAL' category.
****

Let's say you want to restrict your spending for a certain category until a certain deadline.
PalPay allows you to set a budget and serve as a reminder to show how much of the budget set you have left
until the deadline (inclusive). You will be more self-conscious of your spending and minimise your spending by setting a budget. +

To set a new budget: +
1. Type `set` and enter the relevant details (amount, deadline, category) in the format given above. +
2. The result box will display the message `New budget successfully set`. +
3. If the budget already exists in the budget list, the result box will display the message `This budget already exists`. +
4. Now you can see the newly set budget in the budget list.

As you make an *OutTransaction* of a particular `CATEGORY`, your budgets with the same `CATEGORY` will be adjusted
to display the remaining amount of budget. Other budgets in the list belonging to different `CATEGORY` will not be adjusted.
Budget will not take into consideration past *OutTransaction* when calculating the remaining budget. Remember, you are setting a budget
from TODAY till the stated `DATE` (inclusive)! +

If you overspend beyond a set budget, the overspent budget will be displayed in red.
Shown below as budget index 3 is an example of an overspent budget:

.Overspent Budget
image::overspentBudget.png[]

As the day you have set for the budget approaches, the countdown placeholder as well as the percentage remaining placeholder
will turn to red when the number of remaining days reaches 3 and below.
Shown below as budget index 4 is an example of a budget approaching its deadline:

.Budget approaching deadline
image::approachingBudget.png[]

Examples:

* `set $/100 d/010120120 c/BBT`
* `set $/300 d/29022020 c/shopping`


// tag::split[]

[[Split]]
=== Splitting a Bill with Friends : `split`

Split a bill with your friends +
Format: `split $/AMOUNT n/NAME1 a/DESCRIPTION [d/DATE] [n/NAME2]... [s/SHARE]...`

====
* `DESCRIPTION` encompasses more details for the bill being split. User can make use of this
field to determine nature of bill.
* `[SHARE]` defines portion of bill to be paid by each person
** if no shares are given, `amount` will be split evenly across all people, including user
** user is included in the bill if number of shares is *1* more than number of people
*** user's share will be the first listed share
** each person's share is assigned in order
*** i.e. last person's share is the last share listed
** shares cannot be negative numbers
====

===== Ledger GUI

.Sample Ledger Graphical User Interface
image::LedgerUI.png[]

This is how the *Ledger* looks when you switch to the *Ledger* tab. +
The left shows the people who has unresolved balances with you, while the right lists
all transactions that have to do with the *Ledger*. +
*Ledger*'s balance is separate from the *BankAccount*. It is displayed in the same position,
at the bottom right corner.

==== Example Usage:

* `split $/1000 n/Amy n/Betty n/Catherine n/Dan a/haidilao`

 $1000 is split equally between Amy, Betty, Catherine, Dan and the user.

. Enter appropriate command into the command line.
+
.Splitting evenly
image::SplitEven1.png[]
+
. Result is displayed accordingly
+
.Splitting evenly (result)
image::SplitEven2.png[]
+
For an even split of $1000, each person pays $200. Therefore *Ledger* shows $200 on the tab of each person.
*Ledger* balance does not include the amount spent by the user. In this bill, the user is owed $800 in total
from the rest of his friends. Therefore *Ledger* balance is -$800, as shown in the bottom right.

* `split $/100 n/Albert n/Bernard n/Clement s/2 s/1 s/7 a/kbbq dinner`

 $100 is split with Albert owing $20, Bernard owing $10 and Clement owing $70.

. Enter appropriate command into the command line.
+
.Splitting unevenly
image::SplitUneven1.png[]
+
. Result is displayed accordingly
+
.Uneven split results
image::SplitUneven2.png[]
// end::split[]

// tag::receive[]
[[Receive]]
=== Receiving Money from a Friend : `receive`

Receives money from 1 friend +
Format: `receive $/AMOUNT n/NAME1 [d/DATE] [a/DESCRIPTION]`

==== Example usage:

* `receive $/20 n/Albert`

 Transfers $20 from Albert to user. If Albert is no longer owe or is owed money, he will be removed from the Ledger.

. Enter appropriate command into the command line.
+
.Receive payment
image::Receive1.png[]
+
. Result is displayed accordingly.
+
.Receive payment result
image::Receive2.png[]
+
Albert is removed from the *Ledger* since he no longer owes any money. *Ledger* balance is also updated accordingly.
//end::receive[]

[[Project]]
=== Projecting Your Future Balance : `project`

Cast a projection on your future balance amount and budget statuses based on your transaction history. +
Format: `project d/DATE [c/CATEGORY]`

****
* `DATE` input only accepts dates in the following format: DDMMYYYY.
* `DATE` input must be preceded by its tag `d/`.
* `DATE` input must be set in the future.
* `DATE` cannot be more than *720* days from the day of projection.
* `CATEGORY` must be preceded by its tag `c/`.
* There must be a minimum of *5* transactions in total, or in the specified `CATEGORY`
for a projection to be successfully cast.
* Should the number of `transactions` in a `projection` fall below *5*, the `projection`
will be automatically deleted.
****

==== Example Usage:

. `project d/22072020`

 Projected balance: $955.80

. `project d/01012020 c/Food`

 Projected balance: $188.04
 You are on track to meeting your budget of $600 by 08122019, with a surplus of $484.32!

=== Display a Projection Graph: `display`

Display a graphical representation of a `projection` in a new window.

Format: `display PROJECTION_ID`

****
* A `Projection` with `PROJECTION_ID` must exist.
* `Projection` graphs do not update automatically when a new `Transaction` or `Budget` is
added or removed. Instead, they are statically rendered upon the `display` command.
****

==== Example Usage

. Type *display PROJECTION_ID* into the command box and press kbd:[Enter].
+
image::display1.png[]
+
. A new window containing a graphical representation of the specified projection will pop up.
+
image::display2.png[]
+
If there are any budgets associated with the projection, a corresponding graphical
representation of the budget will be additionally displayed.
+
image::display3.png[]
+

[[View]]
// tag::view[]

=== Switching Tabs : `view`

Want to switch tabs without using your mouse? You can switch to another tab with the `view` command.

==== Command Syntax

Format: `view TAB`

****
* `TAB` input only accepts `transaction`, `budget`, `ledger` and `projection` in v1.4. It is case-insensitive.
****

==== Example Usage:

You do not have to use your mouse in PalPay to switch tabs anymore.

[[Delete]]
// tag::delete[]
=== Deleting Finance : `delete`

Deletes the specified Transaction, Budget, Ledger or Projection from PalPay. +


==== Command Syntax

Format: `delete TYPE+INDEX`

****
* `INDEX` refers to the target item number. (Items are sorted starting from the **latest** input added).
* `TYPE` accepts either `t` (Transaction), `b` (Budget), `l` (Ledger) or `p` (Projection). (e.g. `delete b1` refers to deleting a *Budget* of index 1).
* `TYPE+INDEX` requires the TYPE and INDEX to be placed in sequential order (e.g. `delete b 1` or `delete 1` or `delete 1b` will not work).
* You can only delete an existing transaction or budget. Nothing will be deleted if the transaction or budget of `INDEX` does not exists.
* Example: `delete t1` will delete the first transaction from the list of transactions.
****

==== Important Details:

PalPay deletes items based on the entry index of the target item. You can only delete a maximum of 1 entry per command. (i.e. `delete t1 t2 b1` or `delete t1 t2` will not work)

==== Example Usage:

 Deleting the 5th entry of the transactions list

. Note the index of the entry you want to delete. In this example, *entry 5* is the field we will be deleting.
+
image::delete_ug_1.png[]
+
. Since we are deleting a *Transaction* entry of index 5, we will input `t` into our `TYPE` field and `5` into our `INDEX` field.
+
image::delete_ug_2.png[]
+
. Success message will be displayed upon successful deletion.
+
image::delete_ug_3.png[]

===== Example Commands:

* `delete t1`
* `delete b3`
* `delete l2`
* `delete p4`

[[Update]]
=== Updating Finance : `update`

Did you make a mistake in one of your entries? Perhaps you over counted that expenditure you made. PalPay provides you with an `update` feature which helps you change specific fields within your entries.

==== Command Syntax

The `update` feature has different implementations for different entry types. The conditions for the `update` feature is as follows.

Format (Transactions): `update TYPE+INDEX [$/AMOUNT] [d/DATE] [n/ITEM] [c/CATEGORY]` +

Format (Budget): `update TYPE+INDEX [$/AMOUNT] [d/DATE] [c/CATEGORY]` +

Format (Ledger): Cannot be updated +

Format (Projections): Cannot be updated

****
* `AMOUNT` accepts a non-negative, non zero value lesser than 1,000,000.
* `ITEM` accepts the description of this entry.
* `DATE` accepts the date of this entry.
* `CATEGORY` accepts the CATEGORY for the entry.
* At least one `AMOUNT`, `DATE`, `ITEM` or `CATEGORY` fields must be entered. You can input more than 1 of the mentioned fields (e.g. `update t1 $/100 n/milk`).
* `INDEX` refers to the target item number. (Items are sorted starting from the **latest** input added).
* `TYPE` accepts either `t` (Transaction) or `b` (Budget). (e.g. `update t1 ..` refers to updating a *Transaction* of index 1).
* `TYPE+INDEX` requires the TYPE and INDEX to be placed in sequential order (e.g. `update b 1 ..` or `update 1 ..` or `update 1b ..` will not work).
* You can only update an existing transaction, budget or projection. Nothing will be updated if the entry of index `INDEX` does not exists.
* Example: `update t1 $/3000 d/10102019` will update the first transaction from the list of transactions by changing it's *Amount* to $1000 and *Date* to 10/10/2019.
****

==== Important Details:

* `update` requires at least one field to be updated. (e.g. `update t1 $/20 d/10102019 n/milk` and `update t1 $/10` will both be accepted).
* `Ledger` and `Projection` do not have an update function. If you need to change specific fields within a ledger or projection entry, you should delete the target entry and recreate a new entry with your desired fields.
* You can not change an `in` Transaction to an `out` Transaction.
* Changing an expenditure (`out` Transaction) with the same category fields as a `Budget` entry will reflect changes on that particular `Budget` entry as well.

==== Example Usage

===== Example 1:

Updating a *Transaction* entry.

. Identify the index number of the entry you want to edit. In this case, we will be using entry 3.
+
image::update_ug_1.png[]
+
. Put `t` as your `TYPE` input and key in the fields you want to change. In this case, we will only be changing the amount of the transaction.
+

+
. Success message will be displayed upon successful update. Fields will now be updated accordingly.
+
image::update_ug_3.png[]

===== Example 2:

Updating a *Budget* entry.

. Identify the index number of the entry you want to edit
+
image::update_ug_4.png[]
+
. Put `b` as your `TYPE` input and key in the fields you want to change. In this case, we will be changing both the date and amount of this Budget.
+
image::update_ug_5.png[]
+
. Success message will be displayed upon successful update. Fields will now be updated accordingly.
+
image::update_ug_6.png[]

===== Example 3:

Updating a *Transaction* entry which has the same category field as a *Budget* entry.

. Identify the index number of the *Transaction* entry you want to edit.
+
image::update_ug_7.png[]
+
. Notice that a *Budget* entry has the same category field as the *Transaction* entry mentioned above. (*Budget* entry 2).
+
image::update_ug_8.png[]
+
. Put `t` as your `TYPE` input and key in the fields you want to change. In this case, we will be changing only the amount of this *Transaction*.
+
image::update_ug_9.png[]
+
. Success message will be displayed upon successful update. Fields of the *Transaction* entry will now be updated accordingly.
+
image::update_ug_10.png[]
+
. Remaining amount of the *Budget* entry will also be updated accordingly.
+
image::update_ug_11.png[]

===== Example Commands:

* `update t1 $/20 n/coke c/drinks d/12122019`
* `update b2 $/300`
* `update t4 $/30 d/12102019`

[[Sort]]
// tag::sort[]
=== Sorting Transactions : `sort`

Have you ever wonder which is the most expensive transaction you ever made?
Or which is the latest transaction you made? Fret not!
You can now `sort` your transactions according to `date` or `amount`. +
