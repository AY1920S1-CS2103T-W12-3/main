== Introduction

PalPay is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing personal finances*.
More importantly, PalPay is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, PalPay can get your finance management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
